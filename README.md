# Integer-Listedlist
IntLists is a Java program that allows users to input integers into a LinkedList, which is then sorted and displayed. It provides a simple command-line interface for users to enter integers until they type "done". The program handles invalid inputs gracefully and sorts the integers in ascending order using Java's Collections.sort() method.
